<h1>About me</h1>
<p>
  My name is Michal Stovicek and I work as a Cloud Architect/DevOps Engineer. I really enjoy work with
  technologies like Ansible, Terraform, Kubernetes and cloud providers (especially Microsoft Azure).
  I also like coding, however, it is not my daily job and so there are always things to learn (-:
